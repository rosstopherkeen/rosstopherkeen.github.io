You're driving along the road, in your stupidly slow electric bike and there's this black box ahead of you. You try to overtake it but there's just too much incoming traffic. What do you do? Do you wait it out and overtake it? Do you slow down and wait for the box to move farther ahead?

> You can't do **any** of those things.

This black box is the vengeful soul of the road. It makes sure you don't see the potholes (which are abundant on most streets in Mysore, no, India) and your vehicle suffers because of it. This is not just a problem if you use an electric vehicle, basically any vehicle stuck behind an auto in traffic goes through it.
And the fact that most of the autos use kerosene as fuel doesn't help. Now, the government could stop them from plying on roads but that would cause an outrage because it's the main livelihood of a major population. They could try to phase out the older ones and introduce more efficient, silent, environment friendly ones but as we've seen in the past, _people don't like change_.

The best solution to this isn't changing the vehicle, but changing the people who drive them. We've experienced how rude and uncouth auto drivers can be at one point in our lives. We've even seen how they have zero traffic sense, sure there are a few who are really good drivers, but a majority don't follow traffic rules!
I mean, c'mon! Use the fucking indicator instead of your fucking hand to signal a turn. That's why they've put indicators in your stupid machines.
